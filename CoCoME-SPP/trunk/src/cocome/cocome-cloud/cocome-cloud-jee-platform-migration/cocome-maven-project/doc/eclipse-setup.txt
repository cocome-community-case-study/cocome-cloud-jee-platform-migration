# Eclipse Setup

CoCoME makes use of a wide range of Maven plug-ins including glassfish
deployment, code generation, configuration, and others. To be able to
process this information in Eclipse, several plug-ins and connectors 
must be added to your Eclipse installation.

## Prerequisites

- Eclipse Mars.1 or later (other versions my work as well)
- Maven2Eclipse connector (available via Eclipse Marketplace)
- m2c connector for cxf 
  Update Site: https://github.com/ryansmith4/m2e-cxf-codegen-connector.update/raw/master/org.eclipselabs.m2e.cxf.codegen.connector.update-site

Please install all the necessary plug-ins and connectors.

## Import project

Use 'File' > 'Import' > 'Existing Maven Project' to import the CoCoME
maven project.
